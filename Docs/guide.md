# Django REST API Implementation Guide - Step by Step

## üéØ Project Overview
Building a comprehensive Django REST API for a freelance developer portfolio with 7 core domains: Users/Clients, Site Content, Projects, Blog, Services, Products, and Business Operations.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Environment Preparation
- Create Python 3.10+ virtual environment
- Initialize Git repository with README and ERD documentation
- Install core dependencies: Django, DRF, PostgreSQL adapter, authentication, filtering, documentation tools
- Set up `.env` file for environment variables (database credentials, secret keys)

### Step 2: Project Structure Creation
- Generate main Django project
- Create 7 specialized apps mapping to ERD domains:
  - `accounts` - Users and client management
  - `core` - Homepage and about content
  - `projects` - Portfolio showcase
  - `blog` - Content publishing
  - `services` - Service offerings
  - `products` - Digital products (separate from services)
  - `business` - Orders, testimonials, communications

### Step 3: Settings Configuration
- Configure database connection to localhost - (phpMyAdmin)
- Add all apps and DRF to INSTALLED_APPS 
- Set custom user model as AUTH_USER_MODEL
- Configure CORS settings for frontend integration
- Set up media and static file handling
- Configure timezone and internationalization

## Phase 2: Data Layer Implementation üìä

### Step 4: Model Development (App by App)

#### accounts/models.py
- Custom User model extending AbstractBaseUser with role-based access
- Client model with business information and account balance tracking
- User manager for custom authentication flow

#### core/models.py
- HeroSection model for dynamic homepage content
- AboutSection model with JSONB field for social media links
- Ensure single-row tables with proper constraints

#### projects/models.py
- Project model with status enum and client relationships
- Technology model as master reference list
- ProjectGalleryImage for multiple screenshots
- ProjectComment with approval workflow
- Many-to-many through table for project technologies

#### blog/models.py
- BlogPost model with publish/draft status and view tracking
- Tag model for content categorization
- BlogComment with moderation system
- Many-to-many relationship for post tags

#### services/models.py
- Service model with flexible pricing models
- ServicePricingTier for package offerings
- ServiceFeature for tier comparisons
- Supporting models: FAQ, ProcessStep, Deliverable, Tool, UseCase

#### products/models.py (Keep Separate from Services)
- Product model with type enum and licensing
- ProductPurchase for transaction tracking
- ProductReview with rating system
- ProductGalleryImage for product screenshots
- Reuse existing Technology and Tag models through junction tables

#### business/models.py
- Order model linking clients to services/products
- Testimonial model for client feedback
- Notification system for admin alerts
- ContactMessage for lead capture

### Step 5: Database Migration Strategy
- Create initial migrations for each app
- Run migrations in dependency order (accounts first)
- Verify database schema matches ERD
- Create superuser account for admin access

### Step 6: Admin Interface Setup
- Register all models in respective admin.py files
- Customize admin display with list_display, search_fields, filters
- Create inline editing for related models (galleries, tiers, etc.)
- Set up admin permissions for different user roles

---

## Phase 3: API Layer Development üîå

### Step 7: Serializer Architecture

#### Core Serializer Patterns
- Create ModelSerializer for each model
- Implement nested serializers for read operations (include related data)
- Separate serializers for list vs detail views where needed
- Handle sensitive fields (passwords) with write_only configuration

#### Advanced Serializer Features
- Custom validation methods for business rules
- Method fields for computed properties (full_name, average_rating)
- SerializerMethodField for complex read-only data
- Nested creation/update handling for related objects

### Step 8: ViewSet Implementation

#### Standard ViewSet Structure
- ModelViewSet for full CRUD operations on main entities
- ReadOnlyModelViewSet for reference data (technologies, tags)
- Custom ViewSet methods for specific business logic

#### Custom Actions and Endpoints
- @action decorators for non-CRUD operations (like/unlike, publish/unpublish)
- Custom permission classes for role-based access
- Bulk operations for admin efficiency
- Custom lookup fields (slug instead of ID for public endpoints)

### Step 9: URL Configuration and Routing
- DefaultRouter setup for automatic RESTful URL generation
- Nested routing for related resources (project comments, service tiers)
- Custom URL patterns for non-standard endpoints
- API versioning strategy for future updates

---

## Phase 4: Security and Authentication üîí

### Step 10: Authentication System
- JWT token authentication setup
- Custom user authentication flow
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password reset and email verification workflow

### Step 11: Permission Framework
- Role-based permissions (developer, admin)
- Object-level permissions (own content only)
- Public vs authenticated endpoint separation
- Custom permission classes for complex business rules

### Step 12: Data Validation and Security
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Secure file upload handling for images

---

## Phase 5: API Enhancement Features üöÄ

### Step 13: Filtering and Search
- django-filter integration for complex queries
- Search functionality across text fields
- Date range filtering for time-based queries
- Custom filter classes for business-specific filtering

### Step 14: Pagination and Performance
- Pagination configuration for large datasets
- Database query optimization with select_related and prefetch_related
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for performance-critical queries

### Step 15: File Handling and Media
- Image upload and processing for galleries
- File validation and security checks
- CDN integration for media delivery
- Thumbnail generation for product/project images

---

## Phase 6: Quality Assurance üß™

### Step 16: Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for models (validation, methods)
- Serializer tests (input/output validation)
- API endpoint tests (CRUD operations, permissions)
- Integration tests for complex workflows

### Step 17: Test Implementation
- pytest setup with Django integration
- Factory classes for test data generation
- Mock external services and file uploads
- Automated test running in CI/CD pipeline

### Step 18: API Documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generation
- Endpoint descriptions and examples
- Schema documentation for complex requests
- Authentication documentation for frontend developers

---

## Phase 7: Deployment Preparation üì¶

### Step 19: Production Configuration
- Environment-specific settings separation
- Database connection pooling
- Static file serving configuration
- Logging and monitoring setup

### Step 20: Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization
- API response caching
- Background task setup for heavy operations
- Memory usage optimization

### Step 21: Security Hardening
- Production security settings
- HTTPS configuration
- Database security best practices
- API rate limiting and throttling

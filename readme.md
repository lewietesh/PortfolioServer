# API Brief
  - Hello, world!

  - In this project, we are going to build a complete backend application of a freelance developer portfolio, using DJANGO REST API.

  - we will first transform a database design and use it as a foundation to create a fully functional API that is backing an actual business.

 - It will be a professional-level solution that will take care of all the processes a freelance developer requires: client management, the portfolio display, post publishing, services offers, digital products sales, and business operations. 

 - At the end of this session, we will have completed Django project consisting of 7 special apps, more than 20 database models, and an operationalized admin interface. 

 - This practical guide can help you understand Django development and hopefully help you when its finally time to build.  Why dont we create something fantastic together?
